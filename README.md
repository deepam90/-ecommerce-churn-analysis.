Predicting customer retention using RFM and Machine Learning
E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis

📌 Business Problem

To reduce high customer acquisition costs, this project identifies "red flags" and predicts which users are likely to stop using the platform, enabling proactive retention strategies.

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Key Analysis

RFM Analysis: Segmented customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

Feature Engineering: Developed metrics like "Time Since Last Purchase" and "Average Order Value (AOV)."

Preprocessing: Handled class imbalance using SMOTE/weighted loss functions.

Modeling: Developed and compared Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

📊 Insights & Recommendations

Red Flag: 3 weeks of inactivity correlates with a 75% increase in churn probability.

Price Sensitivity: "Flash Sale" shoppers show significantly lower long-term retention.

Strategy: Recommended automated "We Miss You" campaigns with personalized discounts for at-risk segments.

📁 Structure
